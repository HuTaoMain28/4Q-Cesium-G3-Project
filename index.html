            <h3>Eclipse of the Hollowed King</h3>
            <p>
                In an age long past, the world was ruled by the great kingdoms of man, beast, and magic. 
                Now, their remnants lie scattered across the land, swallowed by the sands of time and the 
                creeping grasp of corruption. Yet, a new shadow looms over the realms, for the Hollowed 
                King, long thought to be a myth, has stirred once more. His cursed kingdom rises from the 
                abyss, and with it, the echoes of a forgotten war.

            <h3>ROLES OF THE BRAVE</h3>
            <p>The fate of the world lies in the hands of those who dare to challenge the Hollowed King. 
            Choose your role wisely, for each has a part to play in the battle against darkness.</p>

            <h3>The Way of Hostility</h3>
            <p>In the dark lands of Cesiara, those who dare enter the Hollowed King's realm 
                must face powerful beasts in battle. When the fight begins, the warrior may choose to strike, 
                heal, or flee. Each strike is guided by chance — sometimes strong, sometimes weak. Healing is 
                not always certain, but it may save thy life. Should thee choose to run, the battle shall start 
                again, as if it never happened. Some bosses are not only strong, but clever too — they can heal 
                themselves in the middle of the fight. Only the brave, and a bit of luck, can win the day.</p>
